# BIOL 812 Individual Assignment
### Option #2

### By: Gihyun Yoo

Assignment prepared for BIOL 812 Introduction to Computational Analysis Winter 2022. Created a pipeline to generate random DNA sequences, count the number of bases, and generate histograms of the simulated counts for each base.

# Scripts
1. DNAgen.py - simulates random DNA sequences of a given length
2. BASE.R - counts number of bases for given DNA sequences
3. DNAnalyze.sh - calls DNAgen.py and BASE.R; produces a .csv file with the results
4. BpFigure.R - generates histograms for the DNA base counts

# Pipeline
![pipeline for the BIOL 812 assignment](./Pipeline.png)

1. DNAnalyze.sh calls DNAgen.py and generates 100 sequences of length 1000bp. File names follow this format: DNAseq001.seq ... DNAseq1000.seq
2. DNAnalyze.sh calls BASE.R and uses output from Step 1 to generate counts for each base type. Results are output as DNAseq001.count ... DNAseq100.count
3. DNAnalyze.sh combines all results from Step 2 into a single .csv file: BaseCounts.csv
4. BpFigure.R uses BaseCounts.csv to generate histograms for each base counts (A, G, C, T). The plot is saved as SimulatedBaseCounts.pdf
